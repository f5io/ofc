# Pre-requisites

You must have `now` installed globally (`npm i -g now`) and be logged in.

- Use `yarn dev` to build the dev output and start a `now dev` server.
- Use `yarn prod` to build the output and push up to `now`.

To watch you need to run the two processes separately.

- Start with `yarn watch` and wait until the console prints `done`.
- In a new terminal run `now dev -A now.ofc.json`.
